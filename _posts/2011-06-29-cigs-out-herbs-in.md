Smoking Update: I'm one calendar month in with no cigarettes. Still going strong. And my wife would like me to mention that she is at one calendar month + one week (as in, she's winning).

We stopped by the local home improvement store a couple of weekends ago and picked up a few supplies to start an herb garden in the back yard. Nothing serious yet; just a few basic plants. I absolutely love the smell of basil. Nolene put some other plants in there, but I've no interest so long as the basil is still alive. I now eat a caprese salad three days a week.
