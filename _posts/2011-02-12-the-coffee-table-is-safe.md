excerpt: It's 2011 and burning a DVD is not as reliable as one would expect.

We received a DVD of photos from our wedding photographer a couple of months ago.

My wife has asked several times that I create a few copies.

At this point, I am the proud owner of not one, not two, not three, not four... [let's jump ahead a bit...]

I've got 9 "coasters". N-I-N-E.

It's 2011. Is copying a DVD successfully too much to ask for at this point? If so, when will we have this technology down pat? 2015? 2020?

I'm going to wind up paying somebody to deal with this task. Once I've invested more than an hour, I'm done.
